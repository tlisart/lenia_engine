# Lenia Engine (LE)

There are multiple instances and approaches to computational life sciences and most of the time those are given as exercices to many students of computer science. This project is a side project to not lose some of my programming reflexes and at the same time dabble a bit with the '''Å”ust''' programming language. 

Being the first Rust project I am starting, bugs and failure to comply with some good practices are ineviable, but let's see what we can learn and if we can discover something interesting in the real of logic creatures! 


## What are lenias anyways and what are day, are they out to get you ? 

Lenia is a generalization of no-player games such as Conway's Game Of Life that a lot of people are aware of. Lenia offers a lot of different, suprising and complex emergent patterns in comparison to other game of lifes, it has some interesting properties that one can read on the [open science](https://chakazul.github.io/lenia.html) page. The gliders and other structures have been referenced and is still an active field of research. 

Without further addue, let's get intro the mathematics and principles of Lenia and how we can do some basic research on it to discover some numerical organisms !
